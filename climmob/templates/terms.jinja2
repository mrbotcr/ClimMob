                <h1>ClimMob Terms of Service</h1>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">Last Updated: November 12, 2020 </p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">Thank you for using ClimMob! We are happy you are here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using ClimMob. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible.</p>
                <h3>A. Definitions</h3>
                <ol start='' >
                    <li>The &quot;Agreement&quot; refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; or the &quot;Terms&quot;) and all other operating rules, policies (including the ClimMob Privacy Statement, available at <a href='{{ request.route_url('privacy') }}' target='_blank' class='url'>{{ request.route_url('privacy') }}</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
                    <li>The &quot;Service&quot; refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided at <a href='{{ request.route_url('home') }}' target='_blank' class='url'>{{ request.route_url('home') }}</a> by MrBot Software Solutions.</li>
                    <li>The &quot;Website&quot; refers to ClimMob&#39;s website located at <a href='{{ request.route_url('home') }}' target='_blank' class='url'>{{ request.route_url('home') }}</a> and all content, services, and products provided through the Website. It also refers to MrBot Software Solutions-owned subdomains of climmob.net. Occasionally, websites owned by MrBot Software Solutions may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>
                    <li>&quot;The User,&quot; &quot;You,&quot; and &quot;Your&quot; refer to the person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account, or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 18 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).</li>
                    <li>&quot;We,&quot; &quot;MrBot&quot;, and &quot;Us&quot; refer to MrBot Software Solutions.</li>
                    <li>&quot;Content&quot; refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. &quot;Content&quot; also includes Services. &quot;User-Generated Content&quot; is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. &quot;Your Content&quot; is Content that you create or own.</li>
                    <li>An &quot;Account&quot; represents your legal relationship with MrBot Software Solutions. A &quot;User Account&quot; represents an individual User&#39;s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User&#39;s identity on ClimMob.</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>B. Account Terms</h3>
                <h4>1. Account Controls</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Your Content within it.</li>
                    <li>Within the Service, an User can manage access to data and projects. The User are responsible for the actions that are performed through the User account.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>2. Required Information</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You must provide a valid email address to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, could be optional.</p>
                <h4>3. Account Requirements</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on ClimMob&#39;s Service.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by &quot;bots&quot; or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
                    <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one account.</li>
                    <li>You must be age 18 or older. If we learn of any User under the age of 18, we will terminate that User&#39;s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country&#39;s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country&#39;s laws.</li>
                    <li>Your login may only be used by one person â€” i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people unless your account represents an organization.</li>
                    <li>You may not use ClimMob in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use ClimMob if you are or are working on behalf of a <a href='https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx'>Specially Designated National (SDN)</a> or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>4. User Account Security</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer enough security for accessing your Account, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who collaborate with your Account).</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. MrBot Software Solutions cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
                    <li>You will promptly notify MrBot Software Solutions if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>C. Acceptable Use</h3>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service follows the laws and any applicable regulations.</p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our <a href="{{ request.route_url('usage') }}">Acceptable Use Policies</a>.</p>
                <h3>D. User-Generated Content</h3>
                <h4>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>
                <h4>2. MrBot Software Solutions May Remove Content</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any MrBot Software Solutions terms or policies.</p>
                <h4>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you are posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 and D.5. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting MrBot Software Solutions the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 and D.5. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.</p>
                <h4>4. License Grant to Us</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you, your collaborators and assistants; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.</p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">This license does not grant MrBot Software Solutions the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>
                <h4>5. Moral Rights</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant MrBot Software Solutions the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>
                <h3>E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h3>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us at <a href='mailto:climmob@mrbotcr.com' target='_blank' class='url'>climmob@mrbotcr.com</a>.

                <h4>1. MrBot Software Solutions Rights to Content</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">MrBot Software Solutions retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service.

                <h3>H. Cancellation and Termination</h3>
                <h4>1. Account Cancellation</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with ClimMob. You can cancel your Account at any time.

                <h4>2. Upon Cancellation</h4>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.</p>
                <p style="color: #676a6c">Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request at <a href='mailto:climmob@mrbotcr.com' target='_blank' class='url'>climmob@mrbotcr.com</a> within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.</p>
